# Iris-Dataset-Analysis

#Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Iris dataset using various machine learning techniques. The project will cover data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning models to classify the Iris flower species.

#Tools and Libraries:
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
Pandas and Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
