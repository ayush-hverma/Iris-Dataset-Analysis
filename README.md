# Iris-Dataset-Analysis

# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Iris dataset using various machine learning techniques. The project will cover data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning models to classify the Iris flower species.

# Tools and Libraries:
Python: Programming language used for implementation.
Pandas and Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

# Expected Outcomes:
By the end of this project, we aim to:

Gain a thorough understanding of the Iris dataset.
Successfully implement and evaluate a machine learning model for classifying Iris species.
Draw meaningful insights from the data and model evaluation metrics.
